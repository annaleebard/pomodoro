##What is a pomodoro 
- Does anyone have any guesses? anyone??
- Yes it is the Italian translation of tomato....but what does that have to do with time management?

##What is the Pomodoro Technique
- Time management strategy and a new way of structuring even concepualizing time today we are going to focus on using this technique to reduce digital distraction
- To give a little context: Francesco started using his kitchen timer to work in sprints and get more done...he refined and documented his process. This practice gained particular popularity just as tech started growing in the 1990's. Recently the technique has gained popularity again in the tech industry.

##Why is time management important?
- We Live in a world of interruptions and digital distractions AND THEY ARE COSTLY
-  **Look around at the devices and connections you have at your fingertips. You may have already browsed away from this talk that started 3 minutes ago! You're not alone.** 
- I often feel the day slipping away even when I believe I am "on task"

##The struggle is real
- Technology is developing at lightning speed! Our brain's are overwhelmed and we are trying to cope.
- People are coping in different ways. Many are adopting media diets, writers are trending back toward type writers, developers are removing internet connections from their computers
- Like these folks, We need to protect ourselves from things that creep into our productive time because **it takes our brain more effort and time to regain focus on a task than to continue with it**

- This quote is from an interview with Eric Blumberg, a cognitive psychologist at George Mason University:
> Interruptions have a big cost. And one of the big costs is that it takes actually a very long time once you get interrupted to get back to what you're doing."

- Later in the interview he states **you never really pick up right where you left off**

#How do I do it! - my simplified version

##Step 1 - Clearly define tasks and write down major tasks for the day
- This is easy to skip but the most important step in my opinion unexpected tasks do happen and there are recommendations on how to incorporate these into the pomodoro workflow

##Step 2 - Start your timer and work distraction free
- Have a shared office? you can do this in a group
- Hackers use this regularly in groups because it works!
- My other recommendation include notifying coworkers you are trying a new technique to boost productivity, disable desktop notifications, mute phones, get devices that aren't required for the task at hand out of reach and earshot

##Step 3 - When the timer rings you disconnect from work for 5 minutes
- dont skip breaks or push them back even if you're about to finish the task at hand
- My breaks often looks like this: image of coffee tomato
- at this point I also mark next to my task that one pomodoro has passed and this way i create a metric and overtime can know how long a truly takes to complete which makes tasks more manageable 
- explain to coworker why you blew them off earlier

##Step 4 - After four “pomodoros” have passed, (100 minutes of work time with 15 minutes of break time) you then take a 15-20 minute break.
- Each 25-minute work period is called a “pomodoro”
- The Big break for me means a big coffee! Also take time to stretch your legs, do office yoga, grab a drink of water, or chat with co-workers

##Step 5 - Track pomodoros per task
- Humans have an odd way of thinking of time and tasks. We do not naturally have an objective view of how much effort/time a task takes. Creating this metric allows us to predict how much time a task will require making hitting or beating deadlines much easier!

##Browser Timer [http://tomato-timer.com/](http://tomato-timer.com)
- There are many tech related integrations of Pomodoro Techniques 
- My favorite browser Timer is tomato-timer.com
- desktop notifications, audio notifications, keyboard shortcuts, custom time intervals!


##Browser Extension - "Strict Workflow"
- After install you click the tomato in your browser to start a pomodoro!
- you can set up custom options to block specific websites during your pomodoro which will unlock when you start your break pomodoro
